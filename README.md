# iOS App Challenge

This repository contains the code for an iOS app created as a response to a programming challenge. The goal of this challenge was to demonstrate proficiency in iOS app development, including programming style, skill, approach, and creativity.

## Project Description

The project involved building a simple, native iOS app with at least two screens using a publicly available API. One screen displays a list of items from the chosen API, while the second screen shows a detailed view for those items. The app also includes tests to demonstrate a basic understanding of testing iOS apps. Additionally, 3rd party libraries were used for common tasks such as networking and image loading.
